# Fund Raising

## Grants

The majority of the costs to cover creation of the marketplace are expected to be sourced from grants. However, if this does not cover all costs further funds will be raised through a token offering.&#x20;

## Initial Discord Offering (IDiO)

The first round of funding will be gathered through an Initial Discord Offering, this offering will be to the community members of the Discord only and invite links will be frozen for a duration of time to not allow new members to join during it. The mechanism for price discovery is still up for debate.&#x20;

## Liquidity Bootstrapping (LBP)

The funding gathered in the IDiO will be used to create a liquidity bootstrapping pool with Balancer LBP. The rest of the funding needed should be able to be gathered through this event. If not an IDO/ IDOs will be used.

## IDO

In the case of not receiving enough funding from the LBP an IDO will be created for the rest of the tokens to be distributed.&#x20;
