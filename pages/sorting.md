# Sorting

Two primary sorting features will be included for the MVP. Sort by price and sort by date listed. Other sort functions may arise overtime, such as sort by organization.&#x20;



Include sorting under the following filters:

* By offerer
  * timestamp - newest to oldest / oldest to newest
  * pricing (consideration/offer) - highest to lowest / lowest to highest
* By contract address
  * timestamp - newest to oldest / oldest to newest
  * pricing (consideration/offer) - highest to lowest / lowest to highest
* By contract address && tokenIds
  * timestamp - newest to oldest / oldest to newest
  * pricing (consideration/offer) - highest to lowest / lowest to highest
* By recipient (within consideration item)
  * timestamp - newest to oldest / oldest to newest
  * pricing (consideration/offer) - highest to lowest / lowest to highest
