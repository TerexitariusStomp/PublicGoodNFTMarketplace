# Import New Collection

_Users can set up a profile page and import collections of NFTs they have already deployed elsewhere. This option will be accessible from the My Collections Page_

This page will have explanation text on how to edit the collection data (name, pictures, description, royalty percentages) by registering it on opensea, a form field for the contract address of the collection, and the public funding recipient (drop-down plus search field for a project).&#x20;
