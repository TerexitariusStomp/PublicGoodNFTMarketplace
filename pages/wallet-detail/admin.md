# Admin

_There will be a single page through which admins can allowlist Giveth project verified wallet addresses as potential recipients for platform fees._

There is a button to promote to/demote from admin.

This page will have a form field to add new addresses. This form will ask the Project name, Wallet address, Giveth url.&#x20;

There will also be a display table of the current allowlist. Beside each project row there is a button to deactivate the project (eliminate it from the allowlist). There's also a button on each inactive project to reactivate it. Keeping track of inactive projects helps to avoid projects being added and removed repeatedly from the list without a record as to what happened.
