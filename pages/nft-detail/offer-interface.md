# Offer Interface

On this page there is also the ability to make offers. There is information on the asking price when listed (Price is in ETH). If the user is not the NFT’s owner, they may one of two types of offer on the NFT: solicited or unsolicited. For this there are two buttons, the buy it now button and the make offer button.&#x20;

## Buy Now Button

A solicited offer is made on a listed NFT, at the seller’s asking price. Solicited offers are first come, first served, and do not need to be manually approved by the seller. When this button is pressed a pop up appears with which the visitor can complete the rest of the information needed to complete the purchase.&#x20;

## Make Offer button&#x20;

Unsolicited offers are made on any NFT, listed, or unlisted, and the buyer determines the price. The NFT’s owner must review and accept an unsolicited offer for a transaction to be made. Pressing this button brings up a small modal to allow the user to set the price of their offer. There will be an external link to uniswap to get more WETH (Our marketplace requires WETH for transactions). If the user has insufficient WETH they’ll be pointed to Uniswap or they can reduce their offer.
