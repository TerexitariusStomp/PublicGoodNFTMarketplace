Blockchain Agnostic

We believe in being chain agnostic (Polygon, Ethereum, Wax, Flow etc.) and will be using a layer that is able to be bridged to all of these chains so that our NFTs can be traded on them and the marketplaces that exist on each. We will be starting on Ethereum and expanding to other blockchains from there.&#x20;

Platform Security&#x20;

Contract Audited

We will work with organizations that audit code to ensure that our code is secure. Such as [CertiK](https://www.certik.com/).

Honey Pots and Bounties

We will partner withâ€‹ organizations for creating honeypots and bounties for bugs. This money will come from the revenue of the platform.

Insurance

If an incident is able to overwhelm the security of our contracts and it is not found before the Honeypots and Bounties are able to eliminate it, we will have our entire platform ensured. Insurance contracts we are looking into are [Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io/), [Insurace](https://www.insurace.io/), and [Unslashed Finance](https://unslashed.finance/).

Permanent Storage

A premade storage solution that we can integrate is [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/). This uses IPFS technology&#x20;

Website

We want our website to be recognized by not only it's IP address but also it's ENS, Handshake and other decentralized naming services. We will utilize Fleek to ensure that our website integrates well with these technologies.&#x20;

DEX

We are working to tap into the liquidity of decentralized exchanges, allowing us to be able to accept any coin on the chain the DEX is on as payment for minting the NFTs. When this integration is done we will invest in the DEX partner tokens.
