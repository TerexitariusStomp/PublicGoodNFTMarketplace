# Platform Security

## Contract Audited

We will work with organizations that audit code to ensure that our code is secure. Such as [CertiK](https://www.certik.com/).

## Honey Pots and Bounties

We will partner withâ€‹ organizations for creating honeypots and bounties for bugs. This money will come from the revenue of the platform.

## Insurance

If an incident is able to overwhelm the security of our contracts and it is not found before the Honeypots and Bounties are able to eliminate it, we will have our entire platform ensured. Insurance contracts we are looking into are [Nexus Mutual](https://nexusmutual.io/), [Insurace](https://www.insurace.io/), and [Unslashed Finance](https://unslashed.finance/).
