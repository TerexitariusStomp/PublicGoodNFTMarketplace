# Market Validation

Through Return to Green, Avano has tested the willingness of artists and purchasers of NFTs to support public good. 50+ artists donated artwork to be auctioned off for donations to environmental and mental health organizations on Giveth. Over 5.5 ETH was brought in and donated to organizations on Giveth through 2 events.&#x20;

If NFT marketplaces were to have ingrained 1% of transaction fees going to public goods, a little over USD $1 billion would have gone to public goods since 2017. If we were to gain the market share of organizations like Looksrare, Opensea then weâ€™d be able to channel to public goods per day the same amount we are looking to raise for the MVP (data backing statements above and further market validation: [https://dune.com/hildobby/NFTs](https://dune.com/hildobby/NFTs)).
