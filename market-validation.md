# Market Validation

If NFT marketplaces were to have ingrained 1% of transaction fees going to public goods, a little over USD $1 billion would have gone to public goods since 2017. If we were to gain the market share of organizations like Looksrare, Opensea then weâ€™d be able to channel to public goods per day the same amount we are looking to raise for the MVP (data backing statements above and further market validation: [https://dune.com/hildobby/NFTs](https://dune.com/hildobby/NFTs)).
