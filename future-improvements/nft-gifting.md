# NFT Gifting

Whenever a FeNXT NFT is transferred (within a 24 hour timeframe) the new holder of that NFT receives an additional NFT. As long as the gas costs are deemed reasonable. This NFT has a slight amount of FeNXT token in it. Sending this NFT to the holder makes the holder realize that the layered NFT they just bought (which was transferred to them) is part of our community, further marketing to them and getting them interested in our community.
