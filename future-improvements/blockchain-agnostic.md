# Blockchain Agnostic

We believe in being chain agnostic (Polygon, Ethereum, Wax, Flow etc.) and will be using a layer that is able to be bridged to all of these chains so that our NFTs can be traded on them and the marketplaces that exist on each. We will be starting on Ethereum and expanding to other blockchains from there.&#x20;
