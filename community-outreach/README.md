In Real Life- Physical

Art Studios

Billboards

Crypto has been taking over billboards lately and we can definitely see this marketing opportunity. When available we will use billboards to let people know about the marketplace. &#x20;

Non-Physical

Standards and Guiding Frameworks&#x20;

One of our strongest ways in which to present ourselves to the broader community in a non-physical space is by aligning our actions with standards and guiding frameworks for international development.&#x20;

Project Drawdown

Project Drawdown is one of the most comprehensive climate change adaptation and mitigation frameworks created by a global community. We are working on measuring how the actions we support help in key metrics developed by Project Drawdown
