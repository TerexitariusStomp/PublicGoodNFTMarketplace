Charged Particles needs more creatives using their technology, the world needs more art evocative art that changes the way people think about society, the environment and the world around them, and the ReFi space needs more financial resources getting channeled into it connected to in real life environmental action. The two main technologies able to capture financial resources in web3 are tokens and NFTs. Currently an NFT is only able to be traded when another person wants it. If no one wants that NFT then it is held until a time in the future when someone does, collapsing in price over time with little to no demand. When financially supporting environmental action, the current standard is to receive a receipt of donation. This receipt does not provide a return on the money just sent in support of the environmental action.
