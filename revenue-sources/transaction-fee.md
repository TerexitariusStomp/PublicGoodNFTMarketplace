# Transaction Fee

Primary revenue source will be a percentage fee placed on the trading of NFTs. Well known marketplaces (Rarible, Opensea) charge a 2.5% fee, our marketplace will charge a 1% fee for the maintenance of the marketplace and a 1% fee to go to public good projects. This fee may be eliminated altogether for the maintenance of the marketplace if other revenue sources prove viable and the DAO deems it appropriate.

## Additional Fee- Royalty&#x20;

One additional royalty % and payout address, ownerâ€™s choice. This royalty is paid out for each transaction of that NFT. (Autopopulated from opensea, but owners can overide royalty percentages and payout addresses)
