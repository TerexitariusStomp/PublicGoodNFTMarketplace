# Future Potential Revenue Sources

**Pay Per (Look, Watch, Listen)**&#x20;

Holders or artists (depending on the artistic license granted) can monetize their NFTs through Pay Per (Look, Watch or Listen). When they do a percentage fee is placed to further support Akorn DAO, the holder of the NFT and the artist.

#### Pay Per Look  <a href="#pay-per-look" id="pay-per-look"></a>

A setting is able to be applied to the NFT record to blur the art of the NFT until a payment is made. After this payment is made the image becomes clear so the payer can admire its art.

#### Pay Per Watch  <a href="#pay-per-watch" id="pay-per-watch"></a>

For NFTs that are videos, the payer pays for the video content to be unlocked.

#### Pay Per Listen <a href="#pay-per-listen" id="pay-per-listen"></a>

For content that is audible, payers pay to hear what is embedded.

#### On Reserve <a href="#on-reserve" id="on-reserve"></a>

Artists can choose to have a curated list of individuals eligible to buy their art. Artists need to pay a fee in order to have this occur.
