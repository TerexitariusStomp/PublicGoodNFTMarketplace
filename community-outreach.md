# Community Outreach

In Real Life- Physical

Merchandise

As with any organization one of the ways to get people to know your brand is to have people wear your stuff. We will create sustainable fashion that can be worn in real life but that is sold as NFTs [https://www.auroboros.co.uk/](https://www.auroboros.co.uk/) [https://www.bosonprotocol.io/](https://www.bosonprotocol.io/)

Art Studios

We will partner with studios to host our NFT artwork, such as [IRL art](https://irlart.com/) and [Bright Moments](https://www.brightmoments.io/). There is also the possibility for us to establish our own in real life NFT studio.&#x20;

Billboards

Crypto has been taking over billboards lately and we can definitely see this marketing opportunity. When available we will use billboards to let people know about Akorn. &#x20;

Events&#x20;

We will participate in events both online and in person to be able to have active community involvement one of the first event lists we will be participating in is: http://refispring.com/

Non-Physical

Standards and Guiding Frameworks&#x20;

One of our strongest ways in which to present ourselves to the broader community in a non-physical space is by aligning our actions with standards and guiding frameworks for international development.&#x20;

Project Drawdown

We are working with Colab.Coop on measuring how the actions we support help in key metrics developed by Project Drawdown. Project Drawdown is one of the most comprehensive climate change adaptation and mitigation frameworks created by a global community.&#x20;

Sustainable Development Goals

We are measuring our ability to benefit the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

NFT Gifting&#x20;

Whenever a layered NFT is transferred (within a 24 hour timeframe) the new holder of that NFT receives an additional NFT. As long as the gas costs are deemed reasonable. This NFT has a slight amount (less than the gas cost needed to remove tokens) of an interest-bearing token layered on it that is buying a ReFi token. Sending this NFT to the holder makes the holder realize that the layered NFT they just bought (which was transferred to them) is part of our community, further marketing to them and getting them interested in our community.
