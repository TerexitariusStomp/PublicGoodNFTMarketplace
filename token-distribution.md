# Token Distribution

The best token projects focus on tokens as a means to build network effects and help govern the network. We are still collectively deciding how to allocate tokens but the initial (working charts on) distribution is as follows. If you would like to suggest something please leave us a comment [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KicDCmhtbtf8FscG2B33KrCc5Rc378KTXpHAwCvL2-M/edit?usp=sharing). As we are aiming to raise funds through grant funding, it isn't until after the MVP is created that tokens usage is further defined. Preliminary thoughts are outlined below. &#x20;

## Developers

Coding will be rewarded.

Each time a code is used, 0.00001% of the token supply is distributed.  &#x20;

## Verified Organizations

Once an organization has been donated to through the sale of an NFT that organization gets some tokens.&#x20;

The percent is 0.1% for the first time and each time after 0.05%.  &#x20;

## Artist&#x20;

Each time an artwork is sold on our NFT marketplace, the artist who made that art receives a percent of the token pool.&#x20;

The current percent is 0.01% for each piece of art sold.&#x20;

## Founders

A small percent of tokens are designated to the originators, as a reward for originating the idea and supporting it since the beginning.&#x20;

## Lay community

Tokens distributed to the lay community are described below.&#x20;

### Gifting

When the lay community supports monetarily they are gifted a token. For example: when an NFT is bought for the first time (channeling funds to the regenerative action) the funder gets a percentage of the token pool.&#x20;

Currently this is at 0.1% per transaction.

## DAO Participants

This allotment of tokens will be distributed to all members based upon metrics of contributions.
