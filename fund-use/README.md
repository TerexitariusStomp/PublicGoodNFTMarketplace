# Fund Use

## Development&#x20;

Avano contracted Raid Guild for a design sprint of a public good NFT marketplace- called FeNXT. Bingo (Designer), St4rgard3n (Solidity), Georgeh (FrontEnd), Alicibades (BackEnd) and Sasquatch (Coordination) completed the design sprint with myself, Terexitarius. From the sprint raid Guild estimates $94,225wxDAI needed to complete the MVP of the marketplace in a 12 week timeframe. We are aiming to raise the funds needed for the MVP creation through grants by organizations that'd like to further support the public good.&#x20;

## Operations&#x20;

The establishment of a legal entity for our community that is able to legally issue tokens and comply with regulations will need to be done. This funding is used to recoup these expenses (as the establishment will occur before the distribution of tokens) as well as the continuation of these operations.&#x20;

## Marketing&#x20;

We will want to partner with other decentralized organizations and news outlets to get into the public's perspective. This funding will be used for that.&#x20;

## Legal Framework&#x20;

To make sure we comply with the legal regulations applicable we will hire a legal team. This funding will be used to cover legal expenses.&#x20;

## Contingencies&#x20;

Any unexpected costs should be covered in the contingencies budget.
