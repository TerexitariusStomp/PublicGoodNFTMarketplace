# Amount to Raise- MVP

We are needing to raise $150,000 for the creation of an MVP for this marketplace. The fund use is described below.&#x20;

## Development&#x20;

Avano contracted Raid Guild for a design sprint of a public good NFT marketplace- called FeNXT. Bingo (Designer), St4rgard3n (Solidity), Georgeh (FrontEnd), Alicibades (BackEnd) and Sasquatch (Coordination) completed the design sprint with myself, Terexitarius. From the sprint raid Guild estimates $94,225wxDAI needed to complete the MVP of the marketplace in a 12 week timeframe. We are aiming to raise the funds needed for the MVP creation through grants by organizations that'd like to further support the public good.&#x20;

|                          | Estimate          | Time Estimate     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Webdesign                | $ 12,900 wxDAI    | 3 weeks           |
| Front End                | $ 39,650 wxDAI    | 10 weeks          |
| Smart Contracts          | $ 23,675 wxDAI    | 4 weeks           |
| Backend API and Database | $ 18,000 wxDAI    | 5 weeks           |
| **Total Estimate**       | **$ 94,225wxDAI** | \*\* 12 weeks\*\* |

## Operations&#x20;

The establishment of a legal entity for our community that is able to legally issue tokens and comply with regulations will need to be done. This funding is used to recoup these expenses (as the establishment will occur before the distribution of tokens). $20,0000 is the estimated cost if done through [Otonomos](https://otonomos.com/order/8/new) or another such organization.

## Marketing&#x20;

We will want to partner with other decentralized organizations and news outlets to get into the public's perspective. This funding will be used for that. $30,000 is the estimated cost. For further information on our marketing strategy see [community outreach](../community-outreach.md). We will work with decentralized organizations as much as possible with this, such as [Cre8r.](https://cre8r.vip/)

## Contingencies&#x20;

Any unexpected costs should be covered in the contingencies budget. The initial budget for the MVP is $5,775&#x20;
