# Revenue Sources

## Transaction Fee <a href="#transaction-fee" id="transaction-fee"></a>

Primary revenue source will be a percentage fee placed on the trading of NFTs. Well known marketplaces (Rarible, Opensea) charge a 2.5% fee, our marketplace will charge a 1% fee. This fee may be eliminated altogether if other revenue sources prove viable and the DAO deems it appropriate.

## Marketing <a href="#marketing" id="marketing"></a>

Another revenue source is the marketing featured projects. People can pay (implementing organizations of regenerative activities, artists) to have their NFT record featured in well traveled areas of Akorn's marketplace.

## Pay Per (Look, Watch, Listen)  <a href="#pay-per-look-watch-listen" id="pay-per-look-watch-listen"></a>

Holders or artists (depending on the artistic license granted) can monetize their NFTs through Pay Per (Look, Watch or Listen). When they do a percentage fee is placed to further support Akorn DAO, the holder of the NFT and the artist.

### Pay Per Look  <a href="#pay-per-look" id="pay-per-look"></a>

A setting is able to be applied to the NFT record to blur the art of the NFT until a payment is made. After this payment is made the image becomes clear so the payer can admire its art.

### Pay Per Watch  <a href="#pay-per-watch" id="pay-per-watch"></a>

For NFTs that are videos, the payer pays for the video content to be unlocked.

### Pay Per Listen <a href="#pay-per-listen" id="pay-per-listen"></a>

For content that is audible, payers pay to hear what is embedded.

## On Reserve <a href="#on-reserve" id="on-reserve"></a>

Artists can choose to have a curated list of individuals eligible to buy their art. Artists need to pay a fee in order to have this occur.

## Memberships <a href="#memberships" id="memberships"></a>

Businesses, events, and other membership based communities can tap into our NFT network to offer benefits to them through their NFTs. When the benefits are used, we get a percent of that reward.
