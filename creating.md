# Creating

Avano contracted Raid Guild for a design sprint of a public good NFT marketplace- called FeNXT. Bingo (Designer), St4rgard3n (Solidity), Georgeh (FrontEnd), Alicibades (BackEnd) and Sasquatch (Coordination) completed the design sprint with myself, Terexitarius. From the sprint they estimate $94,225wxDAI needed to complete the MVP of the marketplace in a 12 week timeframe. We are aiming to raise the funds needed for the MVP creation through grants by organizations that'd like to further support the public good.&#x20;
