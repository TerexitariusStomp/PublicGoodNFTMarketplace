General Community

When community members come to the platform (central website) they are, first asked their language of choice then asked to connect their cryptocurrency wallet. If they do not have a cryptocurrency wallet, they are notified as to the disadvantages of interacting with the platform (no NFTs from funding, not able to receive fiat funding back). Once they accept the disadvantages of interacting with the platform without a cryptocurrency wallet or have connected their cryptocurrency wallet, they are directed to a landing page. Every page of the platform is kept super simple so to maximize accessibility.&#x20;

Artist Page

Each NFT artist will have their own page that anyone is able to view and make NFT purchases from. This page will show the floor price for the artist NFTs and how much on average their NFTs are going for. Along with this it will show links to the artists other social channels.&#x20;

Organizational Page

Each organization will have an organizational page that will have their current NFT's that involve their actions, even if the organization is not the holder of that NFT (no matter if the NFT is lazy minted or minted).This page will show the floor price for the NFTs and how much on average their NFTs are going for. Along with this it will show links to other social channels and entity information. All organizations are sourced from Giveth.

Secondary Market

Once the NFTs are bought and sent to the buyer (secondary holder), they are displayed in the secondary marketplace. This marketplace will be curated by the type of art, have sorting filters, and top art will be displayed automatically to the community member based upon the data we know about them.&#x20;
