# DAO Members

## NFT Artists

We value the art that artists put on our marketplace. We curate the artists that are able to list NFTs on our marketplace. The marketplace founders are each given 20 invites to send out to people that they think would create at least 1 NFT on our marketplace. If the person accepts the invitation to create they are sent an email with two further invite links that they can send to people they think would be great artists on the marketplace. This system allows for organic growth and network effect (community curation) of artists on our marketplace.&#x20;

## General Members

Once a visitor has a FeNXT NFT that has some FeNXT token charged in it, they are able to vote on governance proposals.&#x20;

## Human Verified&#x20;

We use anti-sybil technologies (like [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/)) to verify unique members of our community. Once verified these DAO members are able to do what General DAO Members are able to as well as access create suggestions to updates on the customer service bot and create governance forum posts.&#x20;

## Core

The DAO core team has the ability to modify the marketplace or accept suggestions for the modification of the marketplace. There are designated members of the core team that respond to customer service tickets. If enough DAO contributions are noted of a Human Verified DAO member, that member can become part of the core DAO.&#x20;
