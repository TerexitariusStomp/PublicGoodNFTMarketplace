# DAO Members

## General Members

Once a visitor has a FeNXT NFT that has some FeNXT token charged in it, they are able to vote on governance proposals.&#x20;

## Human Verified&#x20;

We use anti-sybil technologies (like [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/)) to verify unique members of our community. Once verified these DAO members are able to do what General DAO Members are able to as well as access create suggestions to updates on the customer service bot and create governance forum posts.&#x20;

## Core

The DAO core team has the ability to modify the marketplace or accept suggestions for the modification of the marketplace. There are designated members of the core team that respond to customer service tickets. If enough DAO contributions are noted of a Human Verified DAO member, that member can become part of the core DAO.&#x20;
