# Artist Communities

We encourage artists to create their own communities, through [tokenizing NFT](https://alchemydao.com/)(s) to make them into DAO tokens, creating [social currencies](https://tryroll.com/) they can put into the treasury of that DAO community or the FeNXT NFTs of their community members, and [interacting ](https://www.coinvise.co/dashboard)with their DAO community. If you would like help in this process our DAO is happy to help. Make sure to get legal advice before creating any token or NFT.
