Currently the ReFi movement has created both tokens and NFTs. Examples of tokens created are from Toucan Protocol (BCT, NCT), Moss (MCO2), Klima (Klima), PrimeDAO (PRIME), RaidGuild (RAID), Gitcoin (GTC), etc. Examples of NFT projects are Unios, NFTree Haus, Endangered Tokens, Public Nouns, Ecolabs, etc. ReFi tokens need more holders to increase the token value and the ReFi NFT projects need increased intrinsic value to gain traction. By layering NFTs with tokens, an intrinsic value of the NFT is able to be created and the tokens have more holders (the NFTs).

We in collaboration with other communities (such as ReFiDAO) continually map out the ReFi space. NFT projects that emerge are whitelisted for being layered and tokens that arise are utilized for layering. Anyone can input tokens into the NFT, not only the holder. Inputing tokens onto the NFT can be done repeatedly.
