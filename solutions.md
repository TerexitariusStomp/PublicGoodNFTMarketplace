NFTs need to be able to increase and or maintain their value over time, the world needs more art evocative art that changes the way people think about society, the environment and the world around them, and in real life public good organizations need more funding.

## ROI For Public Good

Giveth rewards people for donating to public good (with the Giv token and eventually tokens for each org on their platform) and has expressed interest in creating an NFT marketplace to further support organizations on their platform. This marketplace is the first marketplace to step up to meet this demand.&#x20;

Each time a buy or sell happens and a percent of the trade is sent to support an organization on Giveth, it also furthers the artists GIV stream. This incentivizes the artist to continue creating artwork for public good.&#x20;

## FeNXT NFTs

When rewarding people for interacting on the marketplace instead of the tokens being sent directly to wallets, the tokens are embedded in the NFTs themselves. These tokens are time locked so that after a set amount of time the tokens embedded can be taken and traded. During the time that the tokens are embedded in the NFT, the NFT has value not only for the art of the NFT but also for the tokens locked inside. The tokens that are locked inside the NFT can be yield bearing assets, so the NFT grows in value over time as the yield increases. Each individual that interacts on our marketplace will have 1 FeNXT NFT that they choose from their NFT collection. As the FeNXT NFTs grow in value, so does their potential to support public good. &#x20;
